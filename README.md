LIFECALL
YOUR VOICE IS THE CALL FOR HELP
LifeCall OS is a multilingual voice-controlled emergency and healthcare operating system
Designed to assist users—especially the elderly—during critical health situations.
Users can trigger features like ambulance booking, hospital alerts, real-time GPS tracking, and medicine reminders just by speaking in their native language (Tamil, Hindi, etc). 
The system uses speech recognition, and location services to handle emergencies without the need for touch or typing. 
With a single voice command like “EMERGENCY”, the system finds the user's precise location, books the nearest ambulance, notifies hospitals, and launches a live tracking interface. 
It also supports language switching, making it inclusive and accessible for users from diverse backgrounds.
Designed to be lightweight and installable as an APK,
LifeCall OS ensures critical help is just one voice away.
